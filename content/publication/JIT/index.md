abstract: Recent advances in optical fiber sensing have enabled telecom network operators to monitor their fiber infrastructure while generating new revenue in various application scenarios including data center interconnect, public safety, smart cities, and seismic monitoring. However, given the high utilization of fiber networks for data transmission, it is undesirable to allocate dedicated fiber strands solely for sensing purposes. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the reliable coexistence of fiber sensing and communication signals that co-propagate on the same fiber. In this paper, we conduct field trials in a reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM) network enabled by the PAWR COSMOS testbed, utilizing metro area fibers in Manhattan, New York City. We verify the coexistence of real-time constant-amplitude distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), coherent 400 GbE, and analog radio-over-fiber (ARoF) signals. Measurement results obtained from the field trial demonstrate that the quality of transmission (QoT) of the coherent 400 GbE signal remains unaffected during co-propagation with DAS and ARoF signals in adjacent dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) channels. In addition, we present a use case of this coexistence system supporting preemptive DAS-informed optical path switching before link failure.
