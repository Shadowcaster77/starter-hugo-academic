Home stereos are common in most families. Either
implemented in basements or
living rooms, playing music,
movies, or even live concerts, it
is a great way to relax.
However, people may find that
aligning the speakers in their
home stereos tedious. To address this problem, we come up with a novel way by using the techniuqe of beamforming. We build an End-to-End System from a set of speakers, omidirectional microphone, Raspberry-Pi implementing the one-bit phase alignment algorithm which enables our system to produce the best sound effect at any arbitrary locations without physically moving the positions of the speakers.
