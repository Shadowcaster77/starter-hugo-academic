Home stereos are common in most families. Either
implemented in basements or
living rooms, playing music,
movies, or even live concerts, it
is a great way to relax.
However, people may find that
aligning the speakers in their
home stereos tedious. What
annoys them most is that even
when they move around their
furniture, the positions of the
speakers have to move
accordingly. To address this problem, we come up with a novel way to slove this problem using the techniuqe of beamforming.
